I am compiling a list of web microframeworks and sorting them by language. The term 'micro' is pretty subjective, so use common sense when submitting an idea.

Just fork this and submit. Try to keep the styling consistant and alphabetized.

## Ruby
 * [Camping](http://camping.io/) - "a small web framework, less than 4k, a little white blood cell in the vein of Rails"
 * [Cuba](http://cuba.is/) - "Cuba is a Ruby microframework for web development."
 * [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) - "an alternative to other Ruby web application frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Merb, Nitro and Camping"
 * [Rambutan](https://github.com/guilleiguaran/rambutan) - "Ruby web microframework with Rails-ish controllers and routes."
